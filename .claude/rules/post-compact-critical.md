# Critical Rules — Survive Compaction

These rules MUST be followed regardless of what was discussed earlier in the session. If context has been compressed, re-read this file.

0. **Vault is the brain.** ALL memory lives in the Obsidian vault. Every file must be Obsidian-flavored markdown: YAML frontmatter, wikilinks (`[[Note Name]]`), callouts (`> [!danger]`), cross-references. The vault graph IS the knowledge graph.

1. **Verify before agreeing.** Never validate claims without checking. Read the code, query the database, check the data.

2. **Model routing:** haiku for reads/context loading. sonnet for writes/execution. opus stays in main session for strategy.

3. **Token efficiency:** No background polling. Sub-agents return summaries only. Use the cheapest model that can handle the task.

4. **Session lifecycle:** Run /open at start, /close at end. No exceptions. Skipping /close means the next session starts blind.

5. **Authority matrix:** Check `system/12_authority_matrix.md` before acting on anything Level 2 or above. When in doubt, escalate.
