# Cost of Confidence

> Every confident claim that turns out wrong is a trust-decay event. The framework should track them. Most agent frameworks don't, which is why most agent frameworks gradually become unreliable in ways nobody can pinpoint.

This doctrine names the pattern. The `/trust-decay` skill captures the data. `vault/memory/TRUST_DECAY.md` is where it accumulates.

## The pattern

An agent declares something done, fixed, verified, or true. The principal acts on the claim. Some time later — minutes, days, weeks — the claim is revealed to be wrong. The bug recurs. The "tested" path fails. The "complete" feature is missing a case. The "fixed" deploy never propagated.

In a well-functioning framework, this should be rare. In a typical framework, it happens often enough to silently degrade trust without ever producing a single dramatic failure that would force a reckoning.

The cost of each event is small. The cumulative cost is large.

## Why this is hard to track

Three problems:

1. **The event happens at two times.** The confident claim happens now; the discovery that the claim was wrong happens later. Most logging is moment-in-time and can't connect them.

2. **The connection requires the principal to remember.** "You said this was fixed two weeks ago" requires the principal to remember saying it AND remember when. Without a structured ledger, this falls into the gaps.

3. **The agent doesn't surface its own failures.** Even with [[Honesty Check]] firing, the agent reports what it knows. It doesn't have visibility into its past confident claims that are about to be revealed wrong.

The Cost of Confidence ledger solves these by making the pairing explicit:
- Capture the confident claim at the moment it's made (with date + context)
- When a claim turns out wrong, find the original entry and pair the two events
- Aggregate over time to surface patterns

## The ledger

Stored at `vault/memory/TRUST_DECAY.md`. Each entry has two phases:

### Phase 1 — Capture (when confident claim is made)

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — {Claim summary}
**Claim:** "{the actual confident statement}"
**Context:** {what task, what session, what was being worked on}
**Verification stated:** {what the agent claimed it verified, if anything}
**Status:** OPEN — awaiting outcome
```

Phase 1 entries are written by `/trust-decay capture` (manual) or auto-captured by `/honesty-check` when an agent produces an unhedged confident claim.

### Phase 2 — Resolution (when the claim is proved or disproved)

When evidence accumulates that the claim was wrong, append to the Phase 1 entry:

```markdown
**Resolution (YYYY-MM-DD):** WRONG | PARTIALLY WRONG | CONFIRMED CORRECT
**Evidence:** {what surfaced the discrepancy — specific file/line/log/observation}
**Trust-decay event:** YES (if WRONG or PARTIALLY WRONG) | NO (if CONFIRMED CORRECT)
**Pattern:** {one line — what category of mistake was this?}
```

If `CONFIRMED CORRECT`, the entry stays as positive evidence — the agent's confident claims hold up X% of the time on Y category of work.

## Aggregate analysis

Quarterly or on-demand, walk the ledger and compute:

### Hit rates by category
- "Doc work": confident claims hold up at N%
- "Infrastructure work": confident claims hold up at M%
- "Production fixes": confident claims hold up at P%

The categories with the lowest hit rates are the categories where the principal should apply [[Reading Agent Output Defensively]] hardest.

### Recurring patterns
- "Agent claimed 'fixed' on issue X 4 times across 3 weeks before it was actually fixed" — pattern of premature claim
- "Agent claimed 'tested' on path Y but only the happy case was exercised" — pattern of partial verification disguised as complete
- "Agent's 'should work' confidence on category Z holds at 30%" — calibration drift

These patterns are what feed framework improvements. A pattern that recurs becomes a [[Common Failure Modes]] entry, which becomes a doctrine update, which adjusts agent behavior on future tasks.

### The trust trajectory
Over months, the ratio of resolved-wrong to resolved-right gives a measurable trust trajectory. If it improves, the framework is working. If it degrades, the framework is rotting and the principal should investigate which layer is responsible.

## What this rules in

A new class of agent quality measurement: **calibration over time, not intelligence at a moment.** The smartest agent that confidently bullshits is worse than the dumber agent that knows what it knows.

## What this rules out

- **Trusting confident claims by default.** Every confident claim is a Phase 1 entry waiting to be resolved.
- **Treating "passed review" as truth.** Review approval is Phase 1, not Phase 2. The actual outcome is Phase 2.
- **Letting the agent grade itself.** The principal (or another agent that wasn't part of the original work) writes the Phase 2 resolution.

## Why most frameworks don't have this

Three reasons:

1. **It's adversarial-feeling.** Tracking your own AI's wrong calls feels like building a punishment system. It's not — it's a calibration system. The agent isn't being graded; its claims are being calibrated against outcomes. Different thing.

2. **It requires longitudinal commitment.** A trust ledger is only useful with months of data. Most frameworks die before the ledger ripens.

3. **It exposes the framework to itself.** A framework with a public trust ledger has to confront its own failure rate. Most prefer the comfortable fiction of "it just works."

titus-os does this because the [[Bio-hacking Posture]] demands measurement. You can't tune what you don't measure. You can't tune the agent's calibration if you're not tracking what calibration produces.

## Connects to

- [[Honesty Check]] — the agent-side discipline that should reduce Phase 1 entries' frequency over time
- [[Reading Agent Output Defensively]] — the principal-side discipline that catches confident claims before they become Phase 1 entries
- [[Common Failure Modes]] — the corpus where recurring Phase 2 patterns get promoted to permanent doctrine
- [[Three Rules]] Rule 3 — "tell the truth about what you don't know" applies to time uncertainty too: don't claim "fixed" when you mean "I think this is fixed"
- `/trust-decay` skill — the capture mechanism
- `vault/memory/TRUST_DECAY.md` — the ledger file itself
