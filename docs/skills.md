# Skills

Skills are slash commands that trigger predefined workflows. Type the command and Titus executes the protocol.

## Built-In Skills

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/open` | Boot the session — load vault context, surface what matters |
| `/close` | End the session — commit memory, write daily note, update logs |
| `/brief` | Generate a structured delegation brief for any task |
| `/decide` | Run a decision through the 12-lens evaluation framework |
| `/search` | Semantic search over the vault by meaning (local, private) |

## How Skills Work

Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file in `skills/<name>/`. The file contains:
- **Frontmatter** — name, description, trigger command
- **Protocol** — Step-by-step instructions for what the skill does
- **Rules** — Constraints and guardrails

When you type `/open`, Claude Code loads the SKILL.md and follows its protocol.

## Creating Custom Skills

Make a new directory in `skills/` with a `SKILL.md` inside:

```
skills/
  my-skill/
    SKILL.md
```

### SKILL.md Template

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does in one sentence
trigger: /my-skill
---

# Skill Name

[Describe what the skill does]

## Usage

`/my-skill [optional arguments]`

## Protocol

1. [Step one]
2. [Step two]
3. [Step three]

## Rules
- [Constraint or guardrail]
```

### Skill Ideas

Skills that would be useful to build:

- `/review` — Review active priorities, flag what's stale, suggest adjustments
- `/comms` — Check a shared communication channel, process messages, reply or escalate
- `/standup` — Quick status across all active projects in one pass
- `/research [topic]` — Spawn a research agent with structured output format
- `/audit` — Scan the vault for staleness, orphan notes, and broken wikilinks
- `/cost` — Show token spend for current session and cumulative
- `/idea [description]` — Add to the idea queue with automatic 3-gate filter evaluation

### Tips

- Keep skills focused — one skill, one workflow. Don't make Swiss Army knife skills.
- Skills can read from and write to the vault — that's their power.
- Skills can spawn sub-agents for heavy work — the skill defines what model tier to use.
- Test your skill a few times and refine the protocol based on what actually works.
